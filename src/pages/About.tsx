              Mrs. Oluyemisi Fawunmi's legacy is written not in monuments, but in the lives she has shaped across more than three decades of faithful service. Thousands of students who passed through her classrooms carry with them not just a knowledge of Financial Accounting, but the imprint of a teacher who believed in standards, in excellence, and in the dignity of hard work. Her influence extends far beyond any single school — through her work on the Lagos State Financial Accounting curriculum and her role as a WAEC Team Leader and NECO examiner, she has quietly helped define the quality of education delivered to an entire generation of Nigerian students. Colleagues remember her as a leader who led by example, an administrator who never lost the heart of a teacher, and a woman whose faith and integrity were as steady in the staffroom as they were in the sanctuary. In every role she occupied — teacher, year tutor, vice principal, principal — she raised the bar and then helped others reach it. That is a legacy that does not retire.
